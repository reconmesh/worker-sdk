# worker-sdk

Shared Go library every reconmesh worker links against. Carries the wire
contract between the control plane and the workers, plus the runtime
plumbing every worker would otherwise re-implement: River subscription,
Postgres pool, OpenTelemetry tracing, Prometheus metrics, finding
deduplication, graceful shutdown.

The SDK's surface is intentionally tiny — three interfaces, a handful of
types, one `Serve` entry point. New tools implement `Tool.Run` and call
`worker.Serve(t)`. That's it. Everything else is hidden.

## Versioning

`worker-sdk` is the wire contract. Breaking changes cost ~one PR per
worker, so we treat them carefully:

- MINOR / PATCH bumps preserve full backward compatibility.
- MAJOR bumps go through a deprecation cycle of at least one MINOR before
  the old API is removed.
- The SDK ships its own `Version` constant; the control plane reads each
  worker's `manifest.sdk_version` to assert compatibility.

See `../platform/docs/VERSIONING.md` for the org-wide policy.

`internal/` is hidden by Go's tooling — anything outside `worker/` and
`sdk/` is implementation detail and may change without a SemVer event.

## Quick example

```go
package main

import (
    "context"

    "github.com/reconmesh/worker-sdk/worker"
)

type MyTool struct{}

func (t *MyTool) Name() string { return "tm-mytool" }

func (t *MyTool) Run(ctx context.Context, j worker.Job) (worker.Result, error) {
    return worker.Result{
        Findings: []worker.Finding{{
            Kind:     "demo",
            Severity: worker.SeverityInfo,
            Title:    "Hello from " + j.Asset.Value,
        }},
    }, nil
}

func main() { worker.Serve(&MyTool{}) }
```

A worker with that body will:

- read `manifest.yaml` next to the binary
- connect to Postgres (`PG_DSN` env)
- subscribe to its declared phase queue via River
- expose `/metrics` and `/healthz` on `:9090` (configurable)
- emit OTLP traces if `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is set
